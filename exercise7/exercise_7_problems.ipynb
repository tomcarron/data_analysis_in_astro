    "In statistics, the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, commonly referred to as Kendall’s tau coefficient (after the Greek letter $\\tau$), is a statistic used to measure the ordinal association between two measured quantities. A tau test is a non-parametric hypothesis test for statistical dependence based on the tau coefficient. Spearman’s rank correlation is satisfactory for testing a null hypothesis of independence between two variables but it is difficult to interpret when the null hypothesis is rejected. Kendall’s rank correlation improves upon this by reflecting the strength of the dependence between the variables being compared.\n",

    "**b.** By permutation methods we want to derive distributions of Fisher $r$, Spearman’s and Kendall’s statistics. To do this, first we take the uncorrelated data set and randomly assign $x$-values to $y$-values to make new pairs. This should give the range of values of the test statistic which are consistent with there being no correlation. There are $20!$ distinct permutations for even this little dataset. Compute your results for 1000 of these at random. (This is achieved by sampling without replacement from the set of 20 $X$'s and assigning each one in order to the set of $Y$'s) For each of the 1000 random samples compute their Fisher $r$ value, Spearman’s and Kendall’s statistics and plot their cumulative distributions.
